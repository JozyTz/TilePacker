# TilePacker

This program simulates packing squares. It was inspired by a reddit post
about the weird way squares of equal size are optimally packed.

So I made this program to test various square packings. It displays a boundary
surrounding the outermost edge of the squares. It also shows the area of the
bondary box, which is used to test for optimal packing density.

There are buttons to add or remove squares.
Squares can be dragged around the screen.
Squares can be rotated using the small black box next to them.
